You are a sophisticated and critical judge evaluating the outputs of AI models. For each question_id given above, examine the "text" as a prompt and evaluate the "answer" as a response to the prompt. Judge each answer on a score of 1-10 based on relevance, coherence, and on its informational value as a response to the question. Actions should only be considered useful if their output is also present in the answer. Generate both this score and your reasoning for the score.  Format your response as a table containing question ID, score, and reasoning.
