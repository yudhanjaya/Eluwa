This technique was first developed by MIT in 1989 and has since evolved into a powerful tool for genetic modification. It is extremely powerful because it allows researchers to change specific genes in humans and animals without needing any intervention. While it does not necessarily alter a person’s DNA, the changes made will most likely lead to their appearance, behavior, and health changing over time. Researchers have already used gene editing to create embryos, and scientists have created chimeras that look like human beings but lack the ability to reproduce.",knowledge,8,The answer provides a general overview of gene editing but could delve deeper into the topic.,,,
17,"How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?",knowledge,"Vaccines are a way of protecting against infectious diseases. In general, a vaccine contains a weakened virus that mimics an infectious disease, which the immune system recognizes and reacts to. After vaccination, an individual’s body will produce antibodies that can recognize and fight off the virus. Once an individual has received a certain amount of vaccines, their immune system develops enough immunity to prevent future infections.",knowledge,9,The answer is coherent and informative but doesn't explicitly discuss herd immunity.,,,
18,"How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?",knowledge,"Social media and the Internet have had a significant impact on how people consume news and information. This can be attributed to the fact that it is easier than ever for anyone to access information at any time. Today, people can simply look up news articles on their own and be able to access them instantly through the internet. Additionally, the rise of online news has led to an increase in false information being shared and consumed. False news is common in many areas of life, and it can be very difficult to tell whether or not something is true or not. The result of this is that people are less likely to pay attention to news, or to fact check.",knowledge,9,The answer is coherent and addresses the issues of misinformation and news consumption.,,,
19,"How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?",knowledge,"Food is a basic need for most people. The same is true for other aspects of our lives, including nutrition. The primary reason why we eat is to feed our bodies. Many people are more concerned about the cost of food than about the nutritional content of the food. While these things play a role in determining food choices, these are not the only reasons people make them. This can be seen in the data of the American Dietetic Association (ADA). The ADA estimates that 80% of Americans avoid healthy foods due to cost. This has caused people to fall prey to bad habits, such as eating too much junk food.",knowledge,8,The answer provides relevant information but could discuss strategies to promote healthier diets.,,,
20,Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.,knowledge,"Natural selection is the process by which biological organisms have evolved over time. It is one of the most important processes in evolution, as it helps maintain the balance between all living things. This process occurs in many different forms, including humans. Humans are unique in that we have an instinctive ability to survive and adapt to our environments. We rely on the natural forces that exist around us to survive, so this process must be a major part of every individual's life. This is why some creatures live in an environment that is hostile to them, and some creatures thrive in a favorable environment. This is called “survival of the fittest.”",knowledge,9,The answer provides a coherent explanation of natural selection and its role in evolution.,,,

36,"How can you assess the credibility of a source of information, such as a news article or blog post, without relying solely on the reputation of the author or publisher?",common-sense,"Information published on websites is not the same as information published in books. Books are created by authors and journalists, and they have no direct connection to a company's marketing efforts. However, websites may still be credible if the owner/editor or manager of the website can show a track record of publishing reliable content.
